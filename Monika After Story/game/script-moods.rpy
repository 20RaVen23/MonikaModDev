# module that handles the mood system
#

# dict of tuples containing mood event data
default persistent.mood_database

# current mood: still unsure how we want to do this
# default persistent.current_mood

# NOTE: plan of attack
# moods system will be attached to the talk button
# basically a button like "I'm..."
# and then the responses are like:
#   hungry
#   sick
#   tired
#   happy
#   fucking brilliant
#   and so on
#
# When a mood is selected:
#   1. monika says something about it
#   2. (stretch) other dialogue is affected
#
# all moods should be available at the start
# 
# 3 types of moods:
#   BAD > NETRAL > GOOD
# (priority thing?)

# Implementation plan:
#
# Event Class:
#   prompt - button prompt
#   category - acting as a type system, similar to jokes
#   unlocked - True, since moods are unlocked by default
#

# store containing mood-related data
init -1 python in mas_moods:
    
    # mood event database
    mood_db = dict()

    # TYPES:
    TYPE_BAD = 0
    TYPE_NEUTRAL = 1
    TYPE_GOOD = 2
