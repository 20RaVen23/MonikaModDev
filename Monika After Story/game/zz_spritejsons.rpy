# Module for turning json formats into sprite objects
# NOTE: This DEPENDS on sprite-chart.rpy
#
# NOTE: all JSON formats do NOT have prog points. This is a security thing.
#   prog points will be assumed using the type of sprite object and name.
#
# Shared JSON props:
# {
#   "name": "id"
#       - REQUIRED
#       - id for this sprite object. Must be unqiue for the type of object.
#       - This is also referred to in prog points.
#   "img_sit": "base filename for sitting image",
#       - REQUIRED
#       - do not include extension
#   "pose_map": {Pose Map object},
#       - REQUIRED
#       - this is used differently based on object. For more info, see the
#           PoseMap JSON below.
#   "img_stand": "base filename for standing image",
#       - optional
#       - do not include extension
#       - NOTE: generally, this can be left out. We are unlikely to include
#           standing monika anytime soon.
#       - if not given, we assume no standing image
#   "stay_on_start": True if this sprite object should be saved for startup
#       - optional
#       - boolean
#       - default False
#   "ex_props": {arbitrary properties}
#       - optional
#       - additional properties to apply to this sprite object. used for
#            a variety of things. This will be more publicly documented
#           in the future.
#       - NOTE: arbitrary properties can only exist 1 level. (aka no 
#           collections as values of these props)
#       - keys should be strings.
#       - acceptable values are int/string/bool.
#       - default empty dict
#   "select_info": {Selectable object}
#       - optional
#       - providing this will enable the object to be selected in some
#            activities
#       - see Selectable JSON below for more info
# }
#
#
# Additional props for ACS:
# {
#   "rec_layer": recommended layer constant,
#       - optional
#       - integer
#       - See MASMonika class for the constants
#       - if not given, we assume PST (post)
#   "priority": render priority
#       - optional
#       - integer.
#       - lower is rendered first
#       - default 10
#   "acs_type": "type of this acs"
#       - optional
#       - this is not necessary, but used in conjunction with mux_type to 
#           remove potential conflicting acs types
#       - an ACS cannot have multiple types, but it can have multiple
#           conflicting types
#       - default None
#   "mux_type": [list of acs types this conflicts with]
#       - optional
#       - used in confjunction with acs_type
#       - default None
# }
#
# Shared props for HAIR and CLOTHES:
#
# {
#   "fallback": True if the posemap object should be treated as containing
#       fallback codes instead of just enable/disable rules.
#       - optional
#       - boolean
#       - see PoseMap JSONs below for more info
#       - default False
#
# HAIR only props:
#
# {
#   "split": {Pose Map object}
#       - optional
#       - see PoseMap JSONs below for more info
# }
#
# CLOTHES only props:
#
# {
#   "hair_map": {hair string id mappings}
#       - optional
#       - This maps hair string IDs to other hair string IDs. When rendering
#           this clothing item, if the current hair is in this map, the
#           value is used instead.
#       - Use "all" as a key to signify a default for everything to map to.
#       - Use "custom" as a value to map to the generic non-split hair style.
#           This is useful for clothing items with baked hairstyles.
#       - Both keys and values should be strings and should match to an 
#           existing hair ID. 
#       - default empty dict
# }
#
# PoseMap JSONSs
# NOTE: this is used differently based on the sprite object type.
# NOTE: the type is of most props also varies based onusage.
#
# In general:
#
# {
#   "default": value to use as default for all non-leaning poses
#       - optional
#       - default None
#   "l_default": value to use as default for all leaning poses
#       - optional
#       - default None
#   "use_reg_for_l": True will set the l_default value to default.
#       - optional
#       - boolean
#       - basically, this will set the default value for all leaning
#           poses to use the same as non-leaning poses.
#       - default False
#   "p1": value to use for pose 1
#       - optional
#       - This is the "steepling" pose
#       - default None
#   "p2": value to use for pose 2
#       - optional
#       - This is the "crossed" pose
#       - default None
#   "p3": value to use for pose 3
#       - optional
#       - This is the "restleftpointright" pose
#       - default None
#   "p4": value to use for pose 4
#       - optional
#       - This is the "pointright" pose
#       - default None
#   "p5": value to use for pose 5
#       - optional
#       - This is the "leaning-def-def" pose
#       - default None
#   "p6": value to use for pose 6
#       - optional
#       - This is the "down" pose
#       - default None
# }
#       
# ACS (pose_map):
#   Values should be acs ID code (string). This code is part of the filename 
#   for an ACS. This allows you to use a specific ACS image for certain poses.
#
# HAIR (pose_map):
#   If fallback is True, then value should pose names (string). This is used
#       to determine what pose use instead of the desired pose.
#   If fallback is False (default), then value should be (boolean). This is
#       used to determine if a pose should be enabled or disabled for this
#       hair. True values will mean enabled, False means disabled.
#       By default, poses with False values will use steepling instead.
#
# HAIR (split):
#   Values should be booleans. True means the hair is split for this pose. 
#   False means the hair is not split.
#   If this PoseMAp is not given, the hair is assumed to be split for all 
#   poses.
#   This is usually used when a hair is split for upright poses but not
#   leaning poses.
#
# CLOTHES (pose_map):
#   This functions the same as pose_map for HAIR.
